 In reality, human energy fluctuates due to walking load, weather, jet lag, sleep quality, and personal preferences about when to be active or relaxed. As a result, many itineraries that look optimal on paper become unrealistic in practice: travelers get tired mid‑day, slow down, skip planned stops, or abandon the schedule entirely. There is a clear need for itinerary planning systems that explicitly model and adapt to human energy constraints to produce plans that are realistic, sustainable, and responsive to travelers’ physical and cognitive states.
